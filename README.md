# Machine Learning Engineer Udacity Nanodegree - Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Model

## Project Overview

Welcome to the SageMaker deployment project! In this project, a recurrent neural network was built in order to determine the feeling of a film review using the IMDB data set. A model was created using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, a model was implemented and a simple Web application was built that will interact with the implemented model.
